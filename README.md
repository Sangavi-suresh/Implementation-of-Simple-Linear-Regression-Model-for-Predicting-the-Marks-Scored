# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model. 

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the required libraries and read the dataframe.

2.Assign hours to X and scores to Y.

3.Implement training set and test set of the dataframe

4.Plot the required graph both for test data and training data.

5.Find the values of MSE , MAE and RMSE.




## Program:
